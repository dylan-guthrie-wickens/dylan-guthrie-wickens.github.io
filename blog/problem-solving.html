        <h4>What was a time I was stuck on a simple problem?</h4>
        <p>
          Object literals are weird to get your head around. At first, they seem so simple. You have the object itself, which is basically a container. Then you have the properties, which are made of a name and value pair. But! The properties can be objects themselves, or the name value pair could have a function in it. It gets pretty complicated fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the JavaScript Kata, there was a challenge around object manipulation, and assigning new properties, new values, making functions to do these, etc. Instead of taking my time and reading through carefully, I charged headlong into it, and quickly became stuck. Not to be dissuaded however, I trucked on, modified the objects as requested (I thought), and got to a point where only a couple tests were failing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed to work around this by declaring the 'adam' value at the top of the page, and it passed the test! But it didn't feel right, like I had cheated somehow. So I finished most of the other exercises (had similar issues with the 'Gradebook' exercise, and you guessed it, it was objects again), but then on review, realised I had misread the instructions. So I looked through the exercises again, then reread everything I had about objects, looked through some other exercises, and tackled it again, with Google as my trusty companion. This is how I learned that just because the test is being passed, does not mean you are right, and that reviewing your code after a break to see if it still makes sense is very, very important.
        </p>
        <h4>What was a time you elegantly solved a problem?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The above example fairly neatly lines up with a problem I think I solved well, which was the stretch question on the 'Gradebook' exercise, involving writing a function to create an empty 'gradebook' object from scratch, a daunting exercise. From extensive Googling and reading documentation, the [ ] square bracket notation is how you pass in a value that is changing, maybe being iterated through as an array (like object[arrayValue[i]] ), and dot notation means you have to hard code the value. With this 'ah-ha' moment in hand (one of the best feeling ones I have had this whole course), I then went through and refactored a lot of code that I could see might be made more succinct this way. From this I learned that it WILL click, and suddenly make sense, as long as you keep going.

            <h4>When were you reluctant to ask for help, and why?
            </h4>
            <p>In my last job, the 'culture' was pretty awful. I had a lot of responsibilities, and probably took on too much. I severely disliked the idea of failure, and what that meant about me. Still though, I did ask for help when I needed it, when I had to. Being seen as weak by my boss was the main reason, he very hard to work for. It is why I quit, and resolved to never put myself in a position like that again.
